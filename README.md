# API Engine for Weather Data 

The aim of this project is to develop a user-friendly website for accessing historical weather data stored in our database. Rather than displaying all data at once, users can specify a specific time frame using API calls to generate a summary. The website is hosted temporarily on Flask and our database is connected through SQLAlchemy.
